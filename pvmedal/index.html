It is particularly special for me as Petr hasbeen my mentor for some 15 years.<P>For those who don't know Petr, I will first give some backgroundinformation.  Petr hails from the Czech Republic where he obtained hisengineering degree in surveying from the Czech Technical University in1959 and later his Ph.D. in Mathematical Physics from the CzechAcademy of Science in 1968.  In 1967, he and his young family hadalready made their way to England where he worked as a scientist inthe British civil service doing research in geophysics andoceanography.<P>Fortunately for Canada, he came to this country a couple of yearslater in 1969 on an NRC post doctoral fellowship.  At that time thiswas a program designed to attract foreign scientists to Canada.  Thisenabled him to spend a few years working at the Geodetic Survey in thethen Surveys and Mapping Branch of Energy, Mines and Resources.  Weare certainly glad Petr took up this opportunity.  Then in 1971, heaccepted a professorship at the University of New Brunswick in theDepartment of Surveying Engineering (now the Dept. of Geodesy andGeomatics Engineering), where he has been ever since.  In 1974 he andhis family became Canadian citizens and in 1981 he became a registeredmember of the Association of Professional Engineers of New Brunswick.<P>Havning authored over 300 papers, there is simply not enough time hereto go into details about Petr's prolific professional life.  However,I do want to take the time to mention some of the more importanthighlights of his career, including other recognitions of hisachievements.  In typical Canadian fashion, most of these have comefrom outside Canada.<P>One of the first of Petr's important contributions to geodesy, and thefield of numerical analysis in general, was his Ph.D. dissertation onthe development of least squares spectral analysis for unevenly spaceddata series.  First published in 1969, he is still gaining widerecognition for this work, as in the second edition of Press et al.'spopular reference book "Numerical Recipes."  No less impressive arePetr's other technical achievements.  For example, he completed thefirst map of contemporary vertical crustal movements for Canada basedon geodetic data. More recently he has also developed new techniquesfor four dimensional positioning and geoid determination.<P>In recognition of his scientific achievements, Petr became one of onlya handful of geodesists worldwide to receive a Senior VisitingScientist award from the US Academy of Science.  He used the award tospend time during the late 1970's at the National Geodesy Survey,where he worked on, among other things, tidal corrections to geodeticquantities, sea-tide loading, correlations in levelling, and his book"Geodesy:  The Concepts" (see below).<P>Since the mid-1980's, Petr has received a number of of otherprestigious awards and recognitions.  For example, in 1986 he wasinvited to South Africa in 1986 on a research fellowship to report onthe state of geodesy in that country.  The next year he received afellowship of the AGU -- being one of only 15 geodesists (only 5foreigners) to receive the honour.  Not to be undone by the Americans,the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation of Germany awarded him with theDistinguished Senior Scientist award.  This is a particularlysignificant honour, as he is the first and only such Canadian toreceive this prestigious award, which is used to foster scientificcooperation with German scientists.<P>Most recently, in 1993, Petr earned his Doctoral of Science degreefrom the Czech Academy of Sciences, based mainly on his significanttechnical papers in geodesy and numerical analysis.  For those notfamiliar with the D.Sc., it is a state degree that, in many Europeancountries including the Czech Republic, is awarded for internationallypioneering research.<P>Petr has also attracted more than a few millions of dollars in grantsand contracts, most going to support his students, research assistantsand visiting colleagues.  As one of the research staff in the late1980's, I can probably account for a couple of hundred thousand ofthis myself.<P>Petr's career is not only remarkable for his research achievements,but also for his contributions to education.  Almost 40 graduatestudents from all five continents and numerous cultural backgroundshave had the benefit of his tutelage, including yours truly.  Allwould testify to his ability to instill clear thinking, originalityand a hard work ethic.  This he constantly demonstrated to all byexample.  In recognition of his teaching abilities, Petr has receivedmore than one UNB Merit Award for excellence in teaching  andresearch.<P>Petr has also been very generous to all this students and colleagues,both professionally and personally.  I think Galo Carrera summed thisup nicely in his nomination letter: "When economic factors became abarrier to prevent a student from completing a program, he alwaysfound a way, sometimes even out of his own pocket, to assist in whathe calls 'wise intellectual investments.'  He always made sure that ascientific mind was not wasted due to lack of opportunities."<P>In addition to his numerous lecture notes, Petr's greatestcontribution to education is undoubtedly his text book, "Geodesy:  TheConcepts."  Despite being more than 14 years old now, it is still themost comprehensive book on geodesy and is the standard text used forboth undergraduate and graduate courses in geodesy throughout theworld.  This being reinforced by the fact that it has been translatedinto several different languages.<P>I should also make a special note of the 1980's when Petr was a fullprofessor not only at UNB, but also at the University of Toronto inSurvey Science.  Moreover, at the U of T he held cross-appointments inSurvey Science, Civil Engineering and Geophysics.  During this periodhe looked after graduate students at both the U of T and UNB.  It wasduring his time in Toronto that he took myself and others under hiswing as we began our careers in geodesy.<P>Finally, many senior members of the CGU know Petr from another side --that of his significant contributions to the independence of the Unionitself.  Not only did he serve as president from 1987 to 1989, but itwas primarily his determination and political skill that revitalizedthe Union in the late 1980's into the independent society it is today,representing geophysicists of all "stripes."  I think most at thattime would agree that this would not likely have happened withoutPetr's commitment and efforts.<P>It was also his idea to hold the 1987 IUGG assembly in Vancouver onthe 30th anniversary of the last time it was held in Canada (Toronto).Although the Americans were the first to submit their invitation tohold the assembly, it was again Petr's political skill as part of a3-member Canadian delegation that convinced them to recall theirinvitation so that Canada could host it in Vancouver.<P>After all these achievements, international awards and recognition,it's now time we officially honour him ourselves.  My co-sponsors RodBlais, Adrian Camfield, Galo Carrera, Spiros Pagiatakis, Doug Smylie,David Strangway, and I are proud to nominate Petr Vanicek as the firstgeodesist to receive the J. Tuzo Wilson Medal.  Congratulations Petr,you certainly deserve it!<P><I>Michael R.

It is indeed a verygreat honour for me to have been selected the J. Tuzo Wilson medalistfor 1996, and I must thank the Canadian Geophysical Union AwardsCommittee for judging me a worthy recipient.<P>I remember clearly Tuzo Wilson's acceptance speech 18 years ago, whenhe was presented with the first Wilson medal. He said, and I quotefrom memory: "I have been introduced here as one of the members of thefirst graduating class [in geophysics at the Trinity College, Torontoin 1930]. This is not quite correct; I was the graduating class."  Hemust have felt pretty lonely, professionally speaking, after hisgraduation, and I could sympathize with him entirely, as I foundmyself in a very similar situation when I came to Canada some 27 yearsago.<P>Geodesists were in a very short supply in Canada at that time andconsequently, the "name recognition" for geodesy was very low;whenever I was asked to declare my profession, the best reaction Icould hope for was: "ah, a geologist, eh".  Even the late DirectorGeneral of the late Surveys and Mapping Branch of the late Departmentof Energy, Mines and Resources, my first boss in Canada, who wassupposed to know all about geodesy, called us geodesists "the keepersof the grid."<P>Moreover, to most geophysicists, we, the geodesists, are toosuperficial (meaning interested only in the surface of the earth). True, and we are also usually completely ignorant of things geologicalas well as physical.  We do not use any "dancing elephants" to chartthe lithosphere, we do not argue convincingly that the earth creeps atdepth, we do not solve problems that give infinitely many solutions. Surely, to those who do, we must appear somewhat benign, dull, andnit-picking in our eternal hunt for the last millimetre.<P>Our professional standing in Canada has much improved, however, duringthe past few decades, at least as far as our numbers are concerned andas far as international recognition goes.  And it is really on behalfof this new generation of Canadian geodesists, who have brought thisimprovement about, that I accept the medal, with great pride andtrepidation.<P>As CGU has played a significant role in my professional development,it would be impossible for me to resist this occasion to cast a lookback at the history of this august organization.  CGU was inauguratedin 1973 Ñ I hope I have got the year right Ñ after the dissolution ofNational Research Council Associate Committee on Geodesy andGeophysics.  No more public funds would be made available for anygeophysical/geodetic communion, and we had to start looking after ourown needs by ourselves.<P>The CGU was then conceived, first as a joint division of theGeological Association of Canada and the Canadian Association ofPhysicists.  This scheme did not sit well with some of us, who felt wewere neither geologists nor physicists.  Yet, most of us wereconvinced that the only promising future for CGU was in attractingother geophysical families to join with us to build a strongergeophysical tribe.  The only solution to this dilemma that we couldthink of was to become independent while maintaining strong ties withour two adoptive "parent" associations.  An amicable separation wasthen negotiated, and CGU became independent at the tender age of 15.<P>Shortly after the proclamation of independence, the hydrologistsjoined CGU to become a very active and involved arm of the Union. While this is very gratifying, CGU should not stop there; we shouldcontinue working hard to attract other Canadian geophysicists, fluid,applied, fiery, geometrical, whatever their stripe happens to be, intoour Union.  At the same time, we have to compete with our biggerbrotherly organizations, the American Geophysical Union and theEuropean Geophysical Society, for the loyalty of Canadiangeophysicists.  This, by itself is a daunting task but I am hopefulthat with so much brain power and good will assembled within CGU, wecan find a satisfactory solution.<P>I wish to end by thanking my friends, Rod Blais, Galo Carrera, AdrianCamfield, Alfred Kleusberg, Richard Langley, Spiros Pagiatakis, DougSmiley, David Strangway, and of course Mike Craymer once again, forthinking of me at the time of nomination.<P><I>Petr Vanicek<BR>May 9, 1996</I><P><HR><I>Feedback to <A HREF="http://www.craymer.com/">Mike Craymer</A><BR>Last revised 23 April 2000</I></BODY></HTML>
